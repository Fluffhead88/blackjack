# blackjack

This is a game of blackjack that uses object oriented programming. There is a player and a
dealer. Both the player and dealer are dealt 2 cards from 1 deck of cards at the beginning of
the game. The player is then allowed to hit to draw more cards. The dealer is programmed to
automatically hit if their hand vale is less than 17. You're told if someone busts, hits
blackjack and who wins the game.
